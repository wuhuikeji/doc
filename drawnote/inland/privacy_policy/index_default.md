### Software Information

Wu Hui Notes is a feature-rich integrated application that combines note-taking, writing, mind mapping, to-do lists, handwriting, sketching, drawing, and painting, aiming to inspire your imagination and creativity.

### Information We May Collect
Wu Hui Notes does not collect your private information. It only queries the following content unrelated to your personal information:

- **Device Information**: Android version number, Android ID, OpenUDID, OAID, GUID information, etc. These data will be automatically reported when the program crashes, to help us understand bugs in the application version and related device models, facilitating developers to reproduce and solve problems, and improve the stability of the software. We cannot and will not locate specific users or devices through this information.

- **Error Logs**: Relevant code stack information automatically generated by the Android system when the program crashes. We will automatically report it to the Umeng platform via the network. [Umeng Privacy Policy](https://www.umeng.com/page/policy)

### Information You Provide
The **basic functionality of Wu Hui Notes does not require membership registration**. If you need to use the Pro version, registration is required. We provide the following registration methods:

- Email registration, requiring you to provide an email address and set a password.
- Third-party registration, including WeChat, QQ, requiring authorization through third-party applications and obtaining unique identifiers, avatars, nicknames, etc.

**Note**: If you register a Wu Hui Notes account in Wu Hui Notes (this is not necessary), your password will be stored in hashed form on the Wu Hui Notes server. We do not store your password in plain text, and the hash cannot be reversed to obtain your password in plain text. In other words, no one can know your password in plain text because we simply do not store it anywhere, so there is no possibility of leakage or viewing by others.

### Copyright of Works
Wu Hui Notes serves solely as a creative tool. The works you create within it are entirely owned by you. The copyright and other rights of the works belong entirely to you.

### Requested Permissions
To better protect user privacy, starting from Android 11, Wu Hui Notes no longer requires full access to read and write files. Instead, users are asked to specify a folder directory, and Wu Hui Notes will only have read and write permissions for that directory. Therefore, for Android 11 and above systems, Wu Hui Notes will not request any permissions.

For systems before Android 11, Wu Hui Notes will request read and write device storage permissions to implement features such as automatic backup, exporting articles, long images, etc. We will not access any other file content without your knowledge.

### Article Data and Backup
Wu Hui Notes provides two backup methods: local backup and cloud backup. By default, Wu Hui Notes does not automatically backup. Wu Hui Notes only supports third-party cloud storage as your cloud backup space. Wu Hui Notes does not provide official cloud backup services, so you can set your Google Drive, Dropbox, or other cloud storage as the cloud backup service space in Wu Hui Notes. Backup data will be saved in **.dnotes** format at the location you specify, such as in your Google Drive or a specified folder on your device.

**Note: Backup data can only be opened and viewed through Wu Hui Notes.**
