# Privacy Policy

### Software Information

DrawNote is a feature-rich integrated application that combines functions such as note-taking, writing, mind mapping, to-do lists, handwriting, sketching, drawing, and painting, aiming to inspire your imagination and creativity.

### Information We May Collect

DrawNote does not collect your privacy information. It only queries the following content unrelated to your personal information:

- **Device Information**: Android version number, Android ID, OpenUDID, OAID, GUID information, etc. These data will be automatically reported when the program crashes to help us understand the bugs in the application version and related models, facilitating developers to reproduce and solve problems, and improve the stability of the software. We cannot and will not locate specific users or devices through this information.

- **Error Logs**: Relevant code stack information automatically generated by the Android system when the program crashes, which we will automatically report to the Umeng platform via the network. [Umeng Privacy Policy](https://www.umeng.com/page/policy)

### Information You Provide

The **basic functions of DrawNote do not require membership registration**. If you need to use the Pro version, registration is required. We provide the following registration methods:

- Email registration, which requires you to provide an email address and set a password.
- Third-party registration, including WeChat, QQ, which requires authorization through third-party applications and obtaining unique identifiers, avatars, nicknames, etc.

**Note**: If you register a DrawNote account in DrawNote (which is not necessary), your password will be stored in a digested form on the DrawNote server. We do not store your password plaintext, and the digest cannot be reversed to obtain your password plaintext. In other words, no one can know your password plaintext because we do not store it anywhere, and without storage, there is no possibility of leakage or viewing by others.

### Copyright of Works

DrawNote is only a creative tool, and the works created in it belong entirely to you. The copyright and other rights of the works are entirely owned by you.

### Permissions Requested

To better protect user privacy, starting from Android 11, DrawNote no longer requires full read and write permissions. Instead, users are asked to specify a folder directory, and DrawNote will only have read and write permissions for that directory. Therefore, for Android 11 and above systems, DrawNote will not request any permissions.

For systems before Android 11, DrawNote will request read and write device storage permissions to achieve automatic backup, article export, long images, and other content. We will not read any other file content without your knowledge.

### Article Data and Backup

DrawNote provides two backup methods: local backup and cloud backup. By default, DrawNote does not automatically back up. DrawNote only supports third-party network disks as your cloud backup space. DrawNote does not provide official cloud backup disk services, so you can set your Google Drive, Dropbox, and other network disks as the cloud backup service space for DrawNote. Backup data will be saved in **.dnotes** format in the location you specify, such as your Google Drive or the specified folder on your device.

**Note: Backup data can only be opened and viewed through DrawNote.**
